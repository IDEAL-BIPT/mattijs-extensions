- mapMethod
- mapMethod does the distribution
- mapMethod determines the boundary handling
- mapMethod does the normalisation

- needs to return a weight field as well? E.g. percentage mapped?
  (which equals the volume for cellVolumeWeight)

- who does unmapped cells?
    - for sequential these are after all processor meshes are done
      (how to decide if all mapped? Easiest is normalised weight field)
    - for parallel these need to be handled by the mapMethod

- how to map surfaceFields?
- how to map pointFields?
