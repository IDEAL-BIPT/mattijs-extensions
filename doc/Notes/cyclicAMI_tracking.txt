- coincident baffles:
    - some mechanism of referring to one another
    - some mechanism to adjust both areas to add up to ok
- HGW: use new patchType, store neighbourPatchName.
- the only combinations are
    - wall + coupled
    - patch + coupled
    - patch + patch (e.g. switching wall patch to outlet)
    - wall + patch


- tracking:
    - on cyclicAMI: needs triangle-triangle intersection storage to quickly
      determine:
        - other side processor
        - other side face
        - other side triangle

    - on cyclicACMI: same but nonOverlap part needs to know about overlap part
    - on conincident baffles: same. We need to know which side to interrogate.

- cutting: needs triangle-triangle (or poly-poly) intersection.
