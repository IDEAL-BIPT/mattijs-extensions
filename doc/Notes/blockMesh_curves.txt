Edges discretised by interpolation
----------------------------------

- For 'normal' edge projection it uses points along a straight line
between start and end as seeds to find the nearest surface point.

- For edges along a highly curved geometry this is not sufficient and
the edges will tend to cluster. For circular extrusions a
specialised edge-projection method 'projectCurve' and
corresponding geometry 'searchableCurve' will avoid this by calculating
the seed points along surface directly from the curve parameter.

- The searchableCurve geometry describes
a circular extrusion along a discretised curve. The curve format is the
edgeMesh format used in e.g. snappyHexMesh for inputting feature lines.


- (projected) end point after the (projected) start point. If not you'll
have to split the block into two

- start and end plane cannot be perpendicular.

- usual constraints on having too steep a curve with respect to
the radius - there is no checking for crossovers.

- mesh quality is low for a single block pipe.
