offsetting surface:
- using point normal
- using distance-to-wall (iso surface)
- how to avoid cross-overs
- has features? If not how to handle mitering?
- how to smooth out non-extrusion areas
- addressing back onto original surface. Same topology?

cutting:
- move vertices before cutting?
- impossible cuts? Consistency?
- resolve impossible cuts by -tet? -refinement?

infill:
- to original surface point
- perpendicular to snapped point?
- features?
- smoothing?
- feedback to offsetting surface?
