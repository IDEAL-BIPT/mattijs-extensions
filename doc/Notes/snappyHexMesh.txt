offsetting surface:
- using point normal. Problem: requires perfect surface.
  See cfMesh ship5415Octree.
- using distance-to-wall (iso surface). With walking method can have
  originating location info. Still same problems as medial axis.
- how to avoid cross-overs. Feedback loop.
- has features? If not how to handle mitering?
- how to smooth out non-extrusion areas. Easier with mesh - walking
  method based on distance-to-nearest problem point.
- addressing back onto original surface. Same topology?

cutting:
- move vertices before cutting?
- impossible cuts? Consistency?
- resolve impossible cuts by -tet? -refinement?
- cfMesh: cut hexes (with flattened faces) to make prisms, tets

infill:
- to original surface point
- perpendicular to snapped point?
- features?
- smoothing?
- feedback to offsetting surface?
- single cell or all cells in on go. cfMesh does single cell first.
