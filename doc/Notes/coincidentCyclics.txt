cclic baffles / coincident cyclics.

- mapDistribute does not do anything with them:
    - both local
    - no transformation

- the master point does something like:
    forAll(slaves, pointI)
    {
        // Set master info
        info[pointI] = ...

        // Add contributions from slave slots
        ..

        // Push back master info into slave slots
        info[slaves[i]] = info[pointI];
    }

    // Send back to originating processor
    map.reverseDistribute(info);

- this will e.g.
    - on the master point: correctly update the slave data
    - but then the slave point will overwrite the information

- above will correctly work though as long as it is done in
  two passes:

    - all points set their own information
    - masters update their own and local-slave information
    - and push this back (for remote coupled faces)
