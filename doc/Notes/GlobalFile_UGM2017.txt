UGM 2017 Pluggable I/O for OpenFOAM

regIOobject:
------------
- virtual bool read
- virtual bool readData
- virtual bool write
- virtual bool writeData
- readData, writeData for serialisable objects


plug-in:
--------
- etc/controlDict
- -fileHandler
- fileOperation class:
    - virtual filePath
    - virtual objectPath


masterUncollated
----------------
- comparison in number of OS calls


Collated
--------
- Show collated directory structure
- Show collated file format
- Show collated implementation?
- no buffering in collated
- assumes infinitely fast network, slow storage medium.
- however modern SSD: 1Gb/s
- OpenFOAM files not bandwidth/memory limited so master-only
  no big problem.
- timings?


Design
------
- at file level, not regIOobject
- no daisy-chaining. Hardcoded 'collated' format.
- collated: see above about master-only
- collated: needs thread-aware mpi. Slower?
- lagrangian: only on some processors
+ user plug-ins


Examples
--------
regionUncollated:
- case structure
- no file modification checking
