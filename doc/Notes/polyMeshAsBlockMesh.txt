blockMesh:
topology:
- blocks
- edges
- faces
geometry
- points
- edges

If we want to use polyMesh as basis for 'dynamic' blockMesh
- every block is single hex
- block faces are already possible as patches
- missing is
    - description of edges (a pair of mesh points)
    - edge-patches on these edges

Then generating your proper polyMesh is 'just' a matter of
- refining in various directions
- maintaining ordering
    - i for points on edges
    - ij for points on patches
    - ijk for internal points
- moving the points
    - needs correspondence between edges and edge of geometry
      (might be implicit through intersections of two surfaces)
    - needs correspondence between patches and surface of geometry
