- If you're making a correspondence between geometry and (block)mesh

- we want to have a correspondence between blockMesh and geometry, so special
handling (e.g. surface attraction) for faces and selected edges and points.
- I would like to see that preserved in the polyMesh so we can reuse that
correspondence when e.g. mesh morphing.
- the polyMesh does have face information through patches, what is missing is
edge-based patches and point-based patches.
- we can extend pointMesh / pointPatches to have I/O or extend the polyMesh to
include this information.



blockMesh:
topology:
- blocks
- edges
- faces
geometry
- points
- edges

If we want to use polyMesh as basis for 'dynamic' blockMesh
- every block is single hex
- block faces are already possible as patches
- missing is
    - description of edges (a pair of mesh points)
    - edge-patches on these edges

Mesh macros:
0- mesh macro is just a polyMesh in a region
1- each initial block has 6 patches and max 12 feat edges and 8 feat points
2- stitch blocks together (giving patches to stitch and starting point)
    - check that grading and refinement are consistent
    - optionally keep stitch boundary in faceZone for if special interpolation
      needed. Or can we always derive this from location on cell?
      If so we need to maintain which hex face a face originates from
3- optionally
    - merge 'coplanar' patches into single patch.
    - merge 'edges' into single edge.
   Now you have a new macro which is just a new mesh.
4- loop to 2



Then generating your proper polyMesh is 'just' a matter of
- refining in various directions
- maintaining ordering
    - i for points on edges
    - ij for points on patches
    - ijk for internal points
- moving the points
    - user defined:
        - structured interpolation (optional grading)
        - structured interpolation plus 'nearest' to surface
        - needs correspondence between edges and edge of geometry
          (might be implicit through intersections of two surfaces)
        - needs correspondence between patches and surface of geometry

- generate corner points
- edges:
    - generate internal points (using edge grading and interpolation)
    - 'project'
- faces:
    - check consistent edge grading
    - generate internal points (from edge points + interpolation)
    - 'project'
- cells:
    - generate internal points (from face points + interpolation)
    - 'project'
