blockMesh:
topology:
- blocks
- edges
- faces
geometry
- points
- edges

If we want to use polyMesh as basis for 'dynamic' blockMesh
- every block is single hex
- block faces are already possible as patches
- missing is
    - description of edges (a pair of mesh points)
    - edge-patches on these edges

Mesh macros:
0- mesh macro is just a polyMesh in a region
1- each initial block has 6 patches
2- stitch blocks together (giving patches to stitch and starting point)
3- optionally merge 'coplanar' patches into single patch
   Now you have a new macro which is just a new mesh.
4- loop to 2



Then generating your proper polyMesh is 'just' a matter of
- refining in various directions
- maintaining ordering
    - i for points on edges
    - ij for points on patches
    - ijk for internal points
- moving the points
    - user defined:
        - structured interpolation (optional grading)
        - structured interpolation plus 'nearest' to surface
        - needs correspondence between edges and edge of geometry
          (might be implicit through intersections of two surfaces)
        - needs correspondence between patches and surface of geometry
