Dune:
- move parts of processors to other processors
- just use e.g. parMetis on the coarsened matrix

Us:
- probably move parts of processors as well
- two issues:
    - agglomeration not synchronised so more and more processor interfaces
    - also processor interface always at same processor so error always
      in the same place

- do local agglomeration first
- then decide if processor agglomeration
- re-decompose into wanted number of processors (is given?)

- to start: work out
